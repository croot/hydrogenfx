Hydrogen is a modified version of the now unsupported Kusaba software. I have based this software off of serissa (serissa.org) and taken some code from KusabaX (kusabax.org). The goal is to add easier managing features and overall minor enhancements. Some enhancements that have already been completed include keyword autobans, easy analytic script embedding (quantserve, google analytics) and easy ad placement.<br><br>Sorry the download hasn't been updated recently. I have a lot of testing to do and a lot of other things going on.<br>

<b>If you want the new CSS styles, here are the links:</b><br>

just replace the css/oxygen.css or css/nitrogen.css with these
